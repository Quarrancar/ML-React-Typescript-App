# ML-React-Typescript-App

Work in Progressâ€¦ Part 2

This project is a React and TypeScript-based web app, developed using Vite, Tailwind and SWC with Rust as a compiler for a side project to enhance my skills in new web technologies and machine learning. It features a transcription and translation interface that runs ML models in-browser using web workers for efficient processing.
